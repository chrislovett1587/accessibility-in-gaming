                    <p>Accessibility became part of the conversation once the market for videogames had a big boom in popularity. This arguably happened around the time of the Wii, where innovation and accessibility went hand in hand to involve the whole family within the hobby. Although most advancements in accessibility have been made more recently, the industry is taking greater and greater strides to be more inclusive towards those with disabilities. It’s an uphill battle of course. Lots of tweaks have to be made to the software and hardware in order to reduce the burden on the player. If the developers are successful, far more people are able to enjoy these experiences rather than watch from the sidelines. However, those making these tweaks, and those considering doing so, have had to contest or ignore backlash from people who wish to gate-keep the hobby as well as the business culture that aims for the widest audience attainable with the least amount of effort. Regardless, adversity is making way for accessibility, allowing far more people to enjoy games than have ever before.</p>

                        In order for the software to be more inviting a lot more consideration has to be taken into account when crafting the experience. Some methods are tried and true, such as increasing the legibility of subtitles via their size and overlays that help them stand out more from the activity within the game. Many developers have also decreased the strain on motor functions via their options menus, allowing for players to bypass QTEs (quick time events), which often require varied and/or quick inputs to avoid failure, as well as lowering the time restraints often imposed on QTEs. Because of this, players in need of this accessibility are not forced to quit a game or endure a cinematic over and over again just to succeed at a section. Given the much maligned nature of QTEs, it also doubles as a benefit for any player who wishes to not engage with them. This is something many gamers have been requesting for some time!

                        </br>
                        Other additional options that benefit everyone include toggling specific actions within the game, such as sprinting, crouching, and other actions. Allowing a player to decide whether these actions are completed via a button tap or holding the button is a small, yet important, adjustment that improves the flow of gameplay for everyone. Features such as auto run, auto sprint, and auto accelerate also build on top of this idea.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        For a more specific example, according to CIPT’s (Can I Play That?)’s accessibility review of New Tales from the Borderlands, an adventure game sequel to Telltale’s Tales from the Borderlands, featured the above adjustments while also adding the option to remove time limits from all choices within the game. This pairs well with this style of game’s tendency to have all choices be done via the face buttons of the controller. This is a major aspect of direct input from the player for a majority of the game. The accessibility menu itself has a host of options, all of which come with visual representations of what the option does on the right hand side of the screen. The title is still criticized for its lack of feedback on story choices and a lack of a hint system, which can lead to players missing or passing up on vital objects by accident and being confused and lost as a result. Regardless, it did make great strides to include as many players as possible and comes highly recommended as a result.

                        In conjunction with these software adjustments, there are many hardware advancements that work towards the goal of greater accessibility. A direct example is the option on Xbox consoles and windows devices that allows for two people to “copilot” a game. Both players have full control of the game at the same time and thus can play it together. This means one player can control what they’re able to within the game while the other makes more fine tuned and intensive adjustments. This works with existing technologies such as aim assist to make more action-oriented, fast paced games possible for more people to play. It’s a new form of couch co-op that encourages lots of opportunity for bonding, such as two siblings of different skill levels sitting down together to game.

                        </br>
                        Xbox consoles in particular also have accessibility tags, which allow for people to find games with certain accessibility features far easier. They also include completely customizable button mapping, mouse and keyboard support, and adaptive controller support (which we will get into in a moment). There’s also a quick settings menu that includes the features night mode, high contrast mode, and quick access to the controller remapping. Further tweaking of the settings can be accessed right next to each feature via the settings icon next to the toggle.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        The adaptive controller is the biggest foot forward for hardware accessibility seen so far though. It’s a controller that features large buttons and a clear layout in order to ease the physical burden on disabled players that would otherwise keep them from enjoyably playing the game. It’s got full customization too, allowing for any particular player to construct a set-up that caters to their specific needs as much as possible. This is done via the connectors on that back of the controller, which have a slot for each button required and/or used by games for the Xbox consoles and windows computers. Assistive devices include buttons, thumbsticks, joysticks, trigger inputs, mounts, and switches and are all compatible with the 3.5mm jacks and USB ports on the device. This device is also completely compliant with the button remapping on the console, allowing players to customize how their set-up is controlled for easier and smoother gameplay. It of course also includes an audio jack for headphones and other devices to assist with hearing.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        There is a glaring fault in these features though; they all require direct input via the hands or feet which, for some players, is not an option. Should a player need to control a game with their mouth, there is a controller for them called the quadstick. Like the adaptive controller it is completely customizable and allows the player to have certain buttons to be assigned to the different methods of interaction on the controller. The website even has detailed information on how certain adjustments to the build, such as spring strength, requires different angling and mounting with the controller.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        Even still, the quadstick requires certain functions like neck movement and lip strength in order to properly use the controller. Perhaps with time, more advancements will be made such as eye tracking that acts as a controller input or more refined speech recognition. Given the focus on revolutionary and new control methods, such as VR, as well as on voice assistants, it’s only a matter of time before these technologies become more robust, affordable, and easier to implement.

                    <p>Regardless of what comes next, the clear takeaway is that more options for more people is better for everyone overall. Unfortunately, some people do not share this sentiment. An important and crucial way to circumvent this, however, is to pursue these advancements in the face of this opposition and show the great benefits they provide. Fostering a culture of empathy goes a long way towards this as well. Sharing and widening an experience does not cheapen it. The fact of the matter is that more options of how to approach and play a piece of software gives it a far greater chance to reach a higher number of people and succeed. Instead of it staying a niche product it can be enjoyed by an ever-growing number of players. Some will still see this as a “cheapening” of the experience, making it far less special than something more niche and rare, but gaming did not grow by hording its experiences. Far better technologies and more engaging, impressive systems have been developed thanks to the growth of the gaming industry. Videogames do not deserve to have a stagnating audience. They deserve to flourish, as do the people who are often sidelined in favor of the average player. Lately, the industry has made great strides to include as many people as possible in the gaming sphere and, given how much entertainment and joy this has spread, this could only ever be considered a good thing.</p>

                    <p>Given this, efforts should be made to lower the prices of these specialty products. Although their existence is a boon, the cost of them is quite high. Government subsidizing, more efficient manufacturing, or any other method will hopefully allow more people who need these options and controllers to obtain them as well as opening the door for even more people to enjoy these experiences. I would personally love to see this come to pass and would be interested in looking into making it happen, while also spreading a more welcoming culture that enjoys sharing these experiences rather than hoarding them. </p>
